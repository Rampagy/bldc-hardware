# Open Source ESC

This the hardware for my open source custom ESC.

## Kicad

Version 6.0.9

### Setup

Set Kicad environment variable `KIPROJECTLIB` to where the repo is cloned.  This allows Kicad to find the custom schematic and footprint libraries:

* infineon.lib
* Interface_RS485.lib
* STM32F4-DISCOVERY-SIMON.lib
* custom.pretty
